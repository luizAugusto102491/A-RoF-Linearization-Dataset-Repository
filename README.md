# A-RoF-Linearization-Dataset-Repository

This repository hosts a comprehensive dataset tailored for research in analog radio over fiber (A-RoF) systems, focusing particularly on linearization techniques. In A-RoF systems, mitigating nonlinear distortions is crucial, and while machine learning (ML)-based linearization schemes have been explored extensively, the lack of publicly available datasets hampers research progress. 

Here, we address this gap by offering a rich dataset. Leveraging a software-defined radio (SDR) approach, we generate digital samples of the generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) waveform, which are then applied to a real A-RoF system. 

The dataset provided includes both transmitted and received GFDM waveform samples, enabling researchers to train ML models effectively. By facilitating access to this dataset, we aim to foster the development of robust linearization schemes for A-RoF systems. Researchers can utilize this resource to enhance the effectiveness and robustness of ML-based linearization techniques, thus advancing the state-of-the-art in A-RoF technology.
